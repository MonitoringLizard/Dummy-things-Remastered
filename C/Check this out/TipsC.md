# About C

> ### Whats is C?

C is a powerful and widely-used programming language that was created in the 1970s. It is known for being simple, fast, and efficient, making it a popular choice for system programming, such as creating operating systems and embedded systems. C is the foundation for many other programming languages, like C++, Java, and Python, and is praised for giving programmers fine control over hardware and memory. Despite being an older language, it’s still highly valued for learning programming basics and understanding how computers work.

> ### Stuff

Here is some things that you may find valuable during your experience with C

- #### **Compilers**

For you to be able to program in C or even C++, you will need to install a compiler into your computer, even tough that VScode might say to install the C compiler made by Microsoft, by doing a quick research, i found out that its better to install the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) fow now, but its up to you.

- GCC official site: https://gcc.gnu.org/
- MinGW (GCC but for windows): https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/
- #### **Libraries**
- #### **Useful and free courses**

Well, i will say the truth, you wont truly learn C or any other language by purely looking at those dumb files, its much better if you take some courses, but probably you dont want to spend money on it, so heres some free anf good ones that i have taken:

1. (For only portuguese speaking fellas) Curso de JavaScript para pegar o tranco e aprender o básico de programação:

2. BroCode (truly a chad):

3. edX courses, like CS50:
