# Dummy Things
## _Remastered and dumb_

Dummy Things is a repository made by me (Raptop!) and its objective is to store small and simple programs that represent some concepts of a language, in case you have forgotten how variables work in C, some pecularities of Rust, and more... **much more!**

## Features

- Has so far... nothing, i am working on doing for **C** 

## Finally

This is in reality a repository for me to just store my simple programs, and they may lookdumb, but they can serve as way of me looking back and realizing how far i have come

**Thanks for reading!**
